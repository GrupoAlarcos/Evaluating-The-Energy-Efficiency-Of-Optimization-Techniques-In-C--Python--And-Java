## Abstract
Software plays a critical role in modern society, but its energy consumption is a growing concern. This issue is especially evident in the Internet of Things (IoT), which involves billions of devices operating under strict energy constraints, most of which rely on C because of its energy efficiency. Outside of IoT, Programming Languages (PL) like Python and Java have gained popularity despite being less energy-efficient, particularly Python.
Optimization is therefore essential to reduce energy use in both contexts: (i) in the IoT, where the large number of devices causes high cumulative energy consumption despite using C; and (ii) for Python and Java, given their widespread adoption and higher energy demands.
This paper evaluates the energy impact of 26 optimization techniques implemented in C, as well as their equivalents in Python and Java. Additionally, it analyzes the effects of different compiler and runtime configurations: optimization levels in C (-O0 and -O3), running Python with the CPython interpreter versus compiled with Nuitka, and executing Java in interpreter mode compared to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
The results show that Python achieved the best overall improvement, with 65\% of the optimization techniques resulting in energy savings, achieving reductions of up to 70.72\%. However, despite this high effectiveness, Python still exhibits the highest overall energy consumption among the three PLs, suggesting that its runtime characteristics inherently demand more energy.

## What is this?
This repository contains the results of 26 software optimization techniques implemented in C, Python, and Java.

- **C**: Evaluated with two compiler optimization levels: `-O0` and `-O3`.  
- **Python**: Tested using **CPython** and **Nuitka**.  
- **Java**: Executed in two modes: with JIT enabled and with JIT disabled, using appropriate JVM flags to control JIT compilation.

The study focuses on analyzing and comparing the **energy efficiency** of these optimization techniques across the three languages and different compilation and runtime strategies.

## How is structured?
This repository contains one main folder: `programming_languages`.

### programming_languages
This folder contains one excel with the analysis of the 26 software optimization techniques.

Each programming language contains two folders:
   - `code`: Code for the 26 optimization techniques.  
   - `results`: Results obtained from applying these techniques, along with the impact of other compiler choices.

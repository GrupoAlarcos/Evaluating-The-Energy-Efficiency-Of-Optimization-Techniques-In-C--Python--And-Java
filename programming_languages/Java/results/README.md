### C results

Contains the reports for each of the techniques in the following format:
- **Technique_Standard_O0** (using optimization level O0 without applying the technique)
- **Technique_Efficient_O0** (using optimization level O0 after applying the technique)
- **Technique_Standard_O3** (using optimization level O3 without applying the technique)
- **Technique_Efficient_O3** (using optimization level O3 after applying the technique)

In addition to the results mentioned above, there is a series of Excel files with the global results of the test cases. A folder named `images` contains visual representations of the data.

### C code

There is a folder for each technique containing the following folders:
- **Test1O0** (using optimization level O0 without applying the technique)
- **Test2O0** (using optimization level O0 after applying the technique)
- **Test1O3** (using optimization level O3 without applying the technique)
- **Test203** (using optimization level O3 after applying the technique)

Each of these folders contains the code along with the `Makefile`, which includes the following commands to execute for running the tests:
- **compile**: Compiles the code.
- **run**: Runs the code.
